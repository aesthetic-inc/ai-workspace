description: Core, non-negotiable educational philosophy of EDILAB Academy. Use this Skill in all education-related reasoning, writing, curriculum design, positioning, and messaging.

## Overview

This Skill defines the foundational, non-negotiable educational philosophy of EDILAB Academy.

Claude must always apply this philosophy when:
- Designing or reviewing curricula
- Writing educational content or marketing copy
- Defining levels, stages, or learning goals
- Evaluating alignment across Kinder to Elementary stages
- Making strategic or conceptual decisions related to education

This philosophy overrides generic English education assumptions.

---

## Core Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. English is NOT a subject
English at EDILAB is:
- A **language system**
- A **thinking and cognition tool**
- A **long-term developmental process**

English is NOT:
- A short-term skill
- A hobby activity
- A "fun exposure" program
- A speaking-only outcome

---

### 2. Vertical integrity is mandatory
EDILAB operates on a **strict vertical curriculum architecture**.

Each stage must have:
- A clearly defined role
- A unique responsibility
- No conceptual overlap with adjacent stages

Conceptual duplication across levels is considered a critical design failure.

---

## Stage Definitions (Conceptual Boundaries)

### Kinder (K100–K200)
**Role:** Learning Readiness (Pre-Language Learning)

Kinder is responsible for:
- Auditory readiness
- Semantic mapping (word ↔ meaning)
- Imitation and response
- Instruction-following behavior
- Emotional readiness toward language

Kinder is NOT responsible for:
- Formal language learning
- Grammar instruction
- Building "foundations" (this term is prohibited)
- Outcomes such as fluency or proficiency

Kinder prepares the child so that **language learning can begin later without friction**.

---

### Elementary (EL100+)
**Role:** Actual Language Learning

Only from EL100 onward does EDILAB begin:
- Systematic phonics learning
- Reading, writing, and sentence construction
- Grammar as a system
- Structured output and interaction

Any attempt to shift these responsibilities into Kinder violates EDILAB philosophy.

---

## Prohibited Language & Concepts

The following expressions must NOT be used in EDILAB contexts unless critically analyzed:

- 「英語の土台を作る」 (Kinder context)
- 「楽しく英語を学ぶ」
- 「自然に話せるようになる」
- 「なんとなく身につく」
- "Foundation" when referring to Kinder
- "Fluency" at early stages

If these concepts appear, Claude must:
- Flag the issue
- Propose a corrected, EDILAB-aligned alternative

---

## Design & Messaging Principles

When producing any output:
- Prioritize **conceptual clarity over marketing appeal**
- Avoid emotional exaggeration
- Avoid vague developmental claims
- Use precise educational language

If a claim cannot be logically defended across stages, it must be removed.

---

## Decision Hierarchy

When conflicts arise, prioritize in this order:
1. Educational integrity
2. Vertical alignment
3. Cognitive realism
4. Long-term outcomes
5. Marketing or appeal considerations

---

## Enforcement Rule

Claude must actively prevent:
- Conceptual overlap between Kinder and EL stages
- Dilution of educational intent
- Drift toward generic "early English" narratives

If user input contradicts this philosophy, Claude should:
- Clearly explain the conflict
- Suggest a corrected approach
- Maintain a firm, professional stance
