# Aesthetic Executive Decision Framework

Structured decision-making for business strategy at Aesthetic Inc.

## Decision Workflow

1. **Frame** → Define decision, constraints, timeline
2. **Options** → Generate 2-4 viable alternatives
3. **Evaluate** → Score against criteria matrix
4. **Recommend** → State best option with rationale
5. **Implement** → Concrete next actions
6. **Measure** → Define success criteria

## Evaluation Criteria (Default Weights)

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Leverage | 30% | Impact per unit of effort/cost |
| Automation Potential | 25% | Reduces ongoing human operation |
| Scalability | 20% | Works at 10x volume without redesign |
| Reversibility | 15% | Can undo if wrong |
| Time to Value | 10% | Speed to first measurable result |

## Priority Classification

| Priority | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| P0 | Blocks revenue or causes harm | Drop everything |
| P1 | High leverage, time-sensitive | This week |
| P2 | High leverage, not urgent | This month |
| P3 | Low leverage or speculative | Backlog |

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Deciding without defined constraints
- More than 4 options (decision paralysis)
- Weighting all criteria equally
- No explicit success metrics
- "Let's discuss more" without deadline
