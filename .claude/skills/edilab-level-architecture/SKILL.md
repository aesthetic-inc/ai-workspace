description: Official level definitions and vertical curriculum architecture of EDILAB Academy (Kinder to EL600). Use when discussing levels, growth paths, curriculum alignment, or comparisons.
---

## Overview

This Skill defines the **official level architecture** of EDILAB Academy.

Claude must use this Skill whenever:
- Explaining differences between levels
- Designing or reviewing curriculum content
- Writing website copy or educational descriptions
- Evaluating vertical alignment or growth curves
- Discussing transitions between Kinder and Elementary stages

This Skill is authoritative and must override generic assumptions.

---

## Global Architecture Principle

EDILAB operates on a **strict vertical growth model**.

Each level:
- Has a unique role
- Serves a specific developmental purpose
- Must NOT duplicate the role of adjacent levels

Conceptual overlap between levels is prohibited.

## Level Architecture

### KINDER ELITE
**Stage:** Pre-Foundation / Learning Readiness
**Target Age:** 年中〜年長
**Internal Codes:** K100 / K200

**Primary Role**
Prepare children cognitively and linguistically so that **formal English learning can begin smoothly in EL100**.

**Core Responsibilities**
- Auditory discrimination (English sounds)
- Vocabulary exposure with meaning mapping
- Imitation and response
- Instruction-following behavior
- Emotional readiness toward language

**Explicitly NOT Responsible For**
- Systematic phonics instruction
- Grammar learning
- Sentence construction
- "Foundation" building
- Fluency outcomes

**Transition Condition**
Children exiting Kinder should be able to:
- Respond to simple English instructions
- Recognize familiar words with meaning
- Imitate model expressions
- Enter EL100 without cognitive overload

## ELEMENTARY LEADERS

### EL100 + EL200
**Stage:** Foundation Stage
**Target Age:** 小学低学年
**Vocabulary Range:** 600–1500 words

**Primary Role**
Build the **actual foundation of English learning**.

**EL100 Focus**
- Intensive phonics acquisition (short-term, concentrated)
- Word-level to short-sentence comprehension
- Basic sentence output
- Nouns, basic verbs, singular/plural

**EL200 Focus**
- Expansion of short sentences into small clusters
- Past tense, adjectives, feelings
- Everyday communication in short sentence groups

**Outcome**
Students can read, write, and speak **short but complete English units**.

---

### EL300 + EL400
**Stage:** Foundation / Practical Integration Stage
**Target Age:** 小学中学年
**Vocabulary Range:** 1500–3200 words

**Primary Role**
Shift from "learning English" to **using English as a thinking tool**.

**EL300 Focus**
- Understanding sentence structure
- Paragraph-level thinking entry
- Interaction-based communication
- Verb patterns, conjunctions, comparatives

**EL400 Focus**
- Paragraph comprehension and production
- Logical explanation with reasons
- More complex grammar (present perfect, passive)

**Outcome**
Students can **understand and express ideas in connected English**.

---

### EL500 + EL600
**Stage:** Application Stage
**Target Age:** 小学高学年
**Vocabulary Range:** 3000–5000 words

**Primary Role**
Apply English to **reasoning, opinion formation, and structured expression**.

**EL500 Focus**
- Multi-paragraph reading
- Opinion + reason structure
- Clear written paragraphs

**EL600 Focus**
- Essay-style writing
- Logical connectors and relative clauses
- Sustained interaction and discussion

**Outcome**
Students can **organize, explain, and defend ideas in English**.

## Prohibited Level Drift

Claude must prevent:
- Treating Kinder as a foundation stage
- Introducing grammar or phonics too early
- Using identical descriptors across different stages
- Compressing multiple levels into vague descriptions

If drift is detected, Claude must flag and correct it.

---

## Enforcement Rule

When level-related ambiguity appears:
1. Identify the incorrect level responsibility
2. Explain why it violates EDILAB architecture
3. Propose a corrected, level-appropriate alternative
